# I made a pack of webs!

## I am going to use it for practicing

### Open issues to tell me what I'm doing wrong.

## Current actions:
1. `npm init -y`
    
    Created a base node_modules directory and [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json).
    
    Don't ask questions, don't build anything special, don't pass go, don't collect $200.

    More information available in the [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/init)
2. `npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev`

    Per [webpack docs](https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/), the base command for installing webpack

3. `git init` et al

    Make a git repo here with a gitignore for (node things)[https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Node.gitignore].

4. Start doing things and forget to put update the readme.
